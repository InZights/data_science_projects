## Data Science Projects
Welcome to my repository! This collection features a series of Data Science Projects that demonstrate various techniques and approaches in the field of data science. The projects range across different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project includes hands-on work, from data cleaning and exploration to building models and interpreting results.

## About
In this repository, you'll find a variety of data science projects where I explore different types of datasets, apply data analysis techniques, and build machine learning models. The projects highlight my learning journey and the application of real-world data in solving problems.

## Folder Structure
* Each project is contained within its own folder, with the necessary scripts, datasets, and any additional resources.
* Notebooks are used to walk through the projects step by step, explaining the approach and analysis.

## Key Features:
* Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualizations and insights
* Machine learning and statistical modeling
* Model evaluation and validation

## Getting Started
To get started, you can simply clone the repository and navigate to the project folder you're interested in. Each project will typically contain:
* A Jupyter Notebook or Python script outlining the approach
* Relevant datasets (or links to download them)
* Visualizations and analysis results
  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InZights/data_science_projects.git

## Prerequisites
To run the code in the repository, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow
  
You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
